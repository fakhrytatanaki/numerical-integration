NUMERICAL INTEGRATIOM CALCULATOR

due to issues with the implementation of math parser, some expressions involving
minus operators give incorrect results, the issue is fixed by writing negative values
between parenthesis, for example

a - b should be rewritten as a + (-b)
-a - x*b - y should be rewritten as (-a) + (-x)*b + (-y)

all .c files in the src folder should be compiled as done in the makefile

the files can be compiled by using the make command in Linux and macos, (windows require cygwin or WSL to use the make and gcc command)
required tools (gcc for compiling c code)

alternatively, any IDE that supports c or c++ can be used, providing that all files are compiled
